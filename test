While webhooks can send messages, they cannot respond to user interactions such as messages.",

To find it, send that emoji in your server, but put a backslash (\\\\) in front of it.\n\nFor example: sending `\\:my_emoji:` would send `<:my_emoji:12345>` into chat. If you copy the output into Discohook, the emoji will show up properly."

Keep in mind that for users, you must right click their *avatar*, not the message.\n\nTo mention them, you have to use Discord's mention syntax:\n*`<@!user_id>`*, *`<@&role_id>`*, or *`<#channel_id>`*.
